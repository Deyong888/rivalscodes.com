## Step-by-Step Guide to Redeeming Your Rivals Codes

Redeeming your **Rivals codes** in Roblox Rivals is a straightforward process, but it differs slightly from general Roblox promo code redemption. Follow these steps carefully to ensure you claim your free items:

1.  **Launch Roblox Rivals**: Open the Roblox application and navigate to the Roblox Rivals game.
2.  **Complete Initial Tasks**: To unlock the in-game shop feature, you must first complete the first six tasks at the shooting range. This is a one-time requirement.
3.  **Access the Shop**: Once unlocked, locate and click on the **Shop icon** (often represented by a key icon) at the top of your screen.
4.  **Find the Redemption Bar**: Scroll down to the bottom of the shop interface. You will see a dedicated bar, usually labeled something like "Follow the developers to redeem codes" or "Enter Code Here."
5.  **Enter and Redeem**: Carefully type your **Roblox Rivals Code** into the input field. Double-check for any typos, as codes are case-sensitive. Once entered, click the "Redeem" button.
6.  **Enjoy Your Rewards**: A confirmation message should appear, and your free items (Keys, Wraps, Candy, etc.) will be added to your inventory.
