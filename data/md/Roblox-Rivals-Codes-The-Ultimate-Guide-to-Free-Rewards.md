*   **Award Charms:** Prestigious decorative items that showcase your achievements or participation in events. They add a touch of flair to your profile and weapons.

## How to Redeem Your Roblox Rivals Codes Step-by-Step

Redeeming **Roblox Rivals codes** is a straightforward process, but there are a couple of crucial steps to ensure you successfully claim your free rewards. Follow this guide carefully to avoid any hiccups.

### Prerequisites for Code Redemption

Before you can dive into redeeming codes, make sure you meet these requirements:

1.  **Join the Community:** You must first join the official Blue Lock: Rivals Roblox Community group on Roblox. This is a common requirement for many Roblox games to ensure code distribution reaches active players.
2.  **Like the Game:** Head over to the official Roblox Rivals game page and "Like" the game. This shows your support for the developers and often unlocks the ability to use codes.
3.  **Reach Level 10:** Your in-game character needs to be at least Level 10. This prevents bot abuse and ensures that only active players are benefiting from the codes. If you're new, just play a few matches, and you'll hit Level 10 in no time!

### The Redemption Process

Once you've met the prerequisites, follow these simple steps to **redeem Roblox Rivals codes**:

1.  **Launch Roblox Rivals:** Open the Roblox application and navigate to the Roblox Rivals game. Hit the play button to load into the game world.
2.  **Locate the Codes Button:** In the game interface, usually at the bottom of your screen, you'll find a blue "CODES" icon. Click on this button to open the redemption window.
3.  **Enter Your Code:** A text field labeled "ENTER CODE..." will appear. Carefully type or paste one of the **Roblox Rivals active codes** from our list into this box. Double-check for any typos, as codes are case-sensitive.
4.  **Click "REDEEM":** After entering the code, click the "REDEEM" button. If the code is valid and active, you'll receive a success message, and your free rewards will be added to your inventory automatically.

It's that easy! Always make sure your internet connection is stable during the redemption process to prevent any issues.
