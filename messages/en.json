    "seoSection1Title": "What is Rivals Sensitivity Converter?",
    "seoSection1Content": "Rivals True-Aim Calibrator is a professional sensitivity conversion tool that helps players maintain consistent aim feel across different FPS games. By calculating cm/360 (mouse movement distance) and eDPI (effective DPI), you can easily convert sensitivity settings from Valorant, CS:GO, CS2, or Apex Legends to Roblox Rivals, and vice versa.",
    "seoSection2Title": "How to Use Rivals Sensitivity Converter?",
    "seoSection2Content": "Using this tool is very simple: 1) Choose conversion direction (to Rivals or from Rivals); 2) Enter source game sensitivity value and mouse DPI; 3) View recommended Roblox base sensitivity and Rivals multiplier; 4) Apply recommended settings or manually adjust for optimal feel. The tool calculates cm/360 and eDPI in real-time to help you find the best settings.",
    "seoSection3Title": "Why Convert Sensitivity?",
    "seoSection3Content": "Different games use different sensitivity systems, and directly copying values will result in completely different aim feel. By maintaining the same cm/360 value, you ensure the same mouse movement distance for the same view rotation across different games, preserving muscle memory and aim consistency. This is especially important for competitive players.",
    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How do I find my Roblox base sensitivity?",
    "faq1Answer": "Roblox base sensitivity can be found in the Roblox settings menu. This is the global sensitivity setting that affects all Roblox games. The Rivals in-game multiplier slider multiplies on top of this base value.",
    "faq2Question": "What does cm/360 mean?",
    "faq2Answer": "cm/360 means how many centimeters of mouse movement are needed to rotate the in-game view 360 degrees. This is a standardized measurement unit used to compare sensitivity settings across different games. Lower cm/360 values indicate higher sensitivity (less mouse movement for more rotation).",
    "faq3Question": "How does the Rivals multiplier slider work?",
    "faq3Answer": "The Rivals multiplier slider multiplies with the Roblox base sensitivity. For example, if your Roblox sensitivity is 0.2 and Rivals multiplier is 2.0, the effective sensitivity is equivalent to 0.4. You can adjust both values to find the combination that works best for you.",

This is very useful for comparing weapon performance across different scenarios.",
    "seoSection3Title": "How is the Weapon Tier List Calculated?",
    "seoSection3Content": "The weapon tier list is based on a comprehensive scoring system that considers DPS (damage per second), TTK (time to kill), and movement speed modifiers.

    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1Question": "How often is the data updated?",
    "faq1Answer": "Weapon data is regularly maintained based on game version updates. When the game receives balance adjustments, we update relevant data as soon as possible to ensure accuracy and timeliness of information.",
    "faq2Question": "Does the TTK calculator consider damage falloff?",
    "faq2Answer": "The current version of the TTK calculator uses base damage values for calculations. If a weapon has damage falloff, actual TTK may vary by distance. We recommend testing at close and long range separately for more accurate results.",
    "faq3Question": "How to understand movement speed penalties?",
    "faq3Answer": "Movement speed penalty indicates the percentage reduction in movement speed when using that weapon. Negative values indicate reduced movement speed (e.g., -10% means 10% slower), positive values indicate increased movement speed (e.g., +5% means 5% faster). This is very important for tactics requiring quick movement.",
